Statistics:
--annotation-coverage-stats            Whether metalava should emit coverage statistics
                                       for annotations, listing the percentage of the API
                                       that has been annotated with nullness information.
--annotation-coverage-of <paths>       One or more jars (separated by `:`) containing
                                       existing apps that we want to measure annotation
                                       coverage statistics for. The set of API usages in
                                       those apps are counted up and the most frequently
                                       used APIs that are missing annotation metadata are
                                       listed in descending order.
--skip-java-in-coverage-report         In the coverage annotation report, skip java.** and
                                       kotlin.** to narrow the focus down to the Android
                                       framework APIs.

Extracting Annotations:
--extract-annotations <zipfile>        Extracts annotations from the source files and
                                       writes them into the given zip file
--api-filter <file>                    Applies the given signature file as a filter (which
                                       means no classes,methods or fields not found in the
                                       filter will be included.)
--hide-filtered                        Omit listing APIs that were skipped because of the
                                       --api-filter
--skip-class-retention                 Do not extract annotations that have class file
                                       retention
--rmtypedefs                           Delete all the typedef .class files
--typedef-file <file>                  Writes an typedef annotation class names into the
                                       given file

Injecting API Levels:
--apply-api-levels <api-versions.xml>  Reads an XML file containing API level descriptions
                                       and merges the information into the documentation

Extracting API Levels:
--generate-api-levels <xmlfile>        Reads android.jar SDK files and generates an XML
                                       file recording the API level for each class, method
                                       and field
--android-jar-pattern <pattern>        Patterns to use to locate Android JAR files. The
                                       default is
                                       ${"$"}ANDROID_HOME/platforms/android-%/android.jar.
--current-version                      Sets the current API level of the current source
                                       code
--current-codename                     Sets the code name for the current source code
--current-jar                          Points to the current API jar, if any
